## VUE Simple Page 

Hello visitor ! 

This is my first project created using VUE framework. I was focused mainly on RWD solutions and details. But I decided to add minimalistic feature to make this web app a little bit more interesting and interactive.

### Features
1. Main page - all buttons are linked to corresponding section of app. Button to top can brings you to the top of the page. 

2. Form page - feature is really simple. No DS and asynchronous actions. Using only your Local Storage. Fill the inputs with corresponding data in three steps, click submit and voil√†. Click Clear to clear your Local Storage data.
